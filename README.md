# Representation de Connaissances et Raisonnement - Master SII
 This repository contains the practical assignments (TPs) for the Representation de Connaissances et Raisonnement course, focusing on logical reasoning and knowledge representation implemented in Java.

## Contents

This repository includes five assignments:

1-Inférence Logique Basée sur un Solveur SAT
Logical inference using a SAT solver.

2-Logique du Premier Ordre
Explores first-order logic concepts and implementation.
Utilizes the TweetyProject Java library.

3-Logique Modale
Focuses on modal logic for representing necessity and possibility.
Utilizes the TweetyProject Java library.

4-La Logique des Défauts
Implements default logic reasoning.
Leverages the DefaultLogic GitHub repository.

5-Logique de Description
Deals with description logic used in ontology-based representations.
Utilizes the TweetyProject Java library.

## Technologies Used

- Java: Programming language for all assignments.
- TweetyProject: A Java library for logical reasoning and knowledge representation (used in TPs 2, 3, and 5).
- DefaultLogic Repository: GitHub repository used for default logic reasoning (TP 4).

## Additional Tools:
- Default Logic Online Simulator.
- Other relevant GitHub repositories (see Resources).

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher.
- **Maven** *(Optional)*: For dependency management and building the project.

### Steps to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ken0uz/Representation-de-Connaissances-et-Raisonnement---Master-SII.git
   cd Representation-de-Connaissances-et-Raisonnement---Master-SII
2. Import the project into your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Add the required dependencies:

  - For TweetyProject, download or configure it via Maven (check the TweetyProject website).
  - For DefaultLogic, clone the DefaultLogic repository and include it as a dependency.
    
4. Run the main classes or test files for each TP to execute the logic.

### Features
Each assignment focuses on a different aspect of logical reasoning:

1. **SAT-based Logical Inference**: Demonstrates solving logical problems using SAT solvers.
2. **First-Order Logic**: Implements reasoning with quantifiers and predicates.
3. **Modal Logic**: Represents possible worlds and modal operators.
4. **Default Logic**: Handles reasoning with assumptions and defaults.
5. **Description Logic**: Utilizes ontology-based representations for semantic reasoning.
